# REACT MATERIAL UI (PROJECT 1)
#About this project:
This is my First Project using React Component library named "Material UI" in short called as "miui". In this project, I have gained a lot o knowledge of about this library dev tools. I have used the basic interface (can be seen usually in many websites like instagram). The Interface is divided into three block of components out of which two are fixed while one is scrollable depending upon the content present. I have learned a lot of new skills through this project. I will be building more projects over it.
